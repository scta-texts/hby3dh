        <p>
          For all our intellectual cognition begins from sense. 
          Whence the <name>Philosopher</name> says 
          <quote>for anyone lacking sense, it is necessary that they lack knowledge</quote>. 
          And our cognition does not begin from one sense but from two, 
          namely from hearing and sight, 
          which therefore demarcate sense disciplines. 
          Whence Job 13, in the beginning, 
          <quote>my sees all things and my ear hears all things and I have understood</quote>. 
          For this, that the hidden is sufficiently made manifest, 
          the audible teaching and visible example accomplish this. <!-- translation fuzzy --> 
          Thus that they known the hidden things of the heavens and the stars, 
          namely the motions and quantities, some visible examples of the heavens 
          and of the entire world machine are made. Also a audible teaching is written 
          which teaches what for example suits it in the heavens. <!-- translation fuzzy -->
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore just as the entire wisdom of the starts is most excellently in the bodily heavens, 
          but is there hidden from us: the whole in writings, as perhaps in the Almagest of Ptolemy; 
          the whole in wooden instruments as if an example, 
          and there indeed most ignobly. And what is written indeed and these examples 
          are not unless for showing that which is in the bodily heavens: 
          indeed examples through what is seen, writings/a scripture through what is heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          So indeed the wisdom of all things principally and most excellently is in the book of life. 
          But there for the aforesaid reason it is hidden from us. And the whole is in the holy Scriptures 
          and the whole is in the created universe; and each of these is necessary for showing 
          that which is in the book of life: indeed the Scriptures through what is heard, and the universe of creatures 
          as if an example through sight. <ref>Augustine, De Trinitate, book 2, chapter 1</ref>: 
          <quote>I will not be sluggish for inquiring about the substance of God, 
          either through its scripture, or through the creature. Each are given to us for considering this, 
          so that he is sought, he is loved, who has inflamed it; and who created it.</quote> And this wisdom 
          just as in the book of live is the most noble, 
          so in the book of creatures is the most ignoble/obscure, 
          and in the holy scriptures is in a middle mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore just as the astrologer says: the heavens are moved from the east to the west 
          over two poles, one of which is the souther point, the other the north point, 
          just as you see in this wooded sphere. 
          So the theologian says: God is three and one, 
          just as you see in fire, which is one, 
          but nevertheless is disposed in three ways, 
          namely, as heat and light and splendor. 
          Therefore just as the hidden things of the stars 
          are not known by example without what is written, 
          so neither is this wisdom in the divine mind known 
          through the universe of creatures without the holy scriptures. 
          And therefore it is no wonder that those studying physics 
          in the book of creatures alone have made errors, 
          as they are not aware of what in creatures 
          there would be an example in the creator. 
          Thus the holy scriptures are necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the same its sublimity is also clear. 
          For it is sublime or lofty in two ways, 
          namely just as the heavens are said to be high, 
          and just as a well is said to be deep, that is profound and lofty; 
          and indeed each makes an altitude. 
          For what is profound to what is existing above; 
          and what is deep to what is existing below.
        </p>
        <p>
          For just as has already been said: in this 
          are all things which are in the divine mind.
          But in the divine mind are all things. Therefore also in this. 
          To which Augustine attests in book 2 of <title>De doctrina christiana</title>, 
          saying every truth is found it with these words: 
          <quote>
            Quantum...humilitate discuntur
          </quote>
        </p>
        <p>
          For who doubts that in God are all things? For the <ref><name>Apostle says</name> Ro 11</ref> 
          <quote>in whom all things</quote>
          And in the Book of Causes, proposition 21: 
          <quote>primum ... dives maius</quote>
          But the university of creatures is a singularly perfect example of all things 
          which are in the mind of the artist; 
          otherwise the world would not be perfect. 
          But now it has been written <ref>Deu 32</ref> <quote>the works of God are perfect</quote>.
          But whatever are in the example of this doctrine,
          in as much as it is an example, are necessarily in this doctrine.
          Therefore indeed all things 
          are in holy scripture, namely the highest and the lowest. 
          <ref>Sap 8, at the end</ref>, concerning this: 
          <quote>Attingit a fine usque ad finem fortiter</quote>
          that is from the supreme 
          which is the highest end to the lowest, 
          which in the lowest end. 
          <ref>Sap 18</ref>
          <quote>he was obtaining up to the heavens while standing on the earth</quote>
          And <ref>Ecclus 24</ref> this wisdom says: 
          <quote>Girum caeli circuivi sola, et in profundum abyssi penetravi</quote>
          Therefore this is the highest altitude and greatest profundity. 
          Whence <ref>Eccles. 7</ref>
          <quote>High profundity, who create this?</quote>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore since both the altitude and profundity fall under sublimity, 
          who should marvel if the apostle admiring this marvelous sublimity exclaims: 
          <quote>O altitude of the riches of the wisdom and science of God</quote>
          Indeed which wisdom is said inasmuch as it spoken about the highest things; 
          but science inasmuch as it exemplifies the lowest things. 
          Wisdom is when it says: God is three and one; 
          science is when it applies to the following: 
          just one fire has three things within itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here at once it is clear that all other sciences are 
          the attendants and handmaidens. For individuals are 
          from individual parts of a universe, 
          but the whole universe is to this, 
          just an example to a science of which it is an example. 
          This is clear because all other things work for the declaration 
          of the examples of this science.
        </p>
        <p>
          About this it is clear 
          that it is necessary that the one approach it 
          knows beforehand all things or for the most part; 
          otherwise he will be unaware of the examples of this science. 
          For one does not approach this mistress, 
          most especially to the secrecy of his bed chamber, 
          unless there is first an acquaintance with the 
          handmaidens which introduce him. 
          Whence <ref>Gal. 4</ref>
          <quote>Abraham had two sons, 
          one from a handmaid, and another from a free woman</quote>.
          Note that the handmaiden comes first 
          and the free woman after, 
          just as is written in <ref>Gen 16</ref>
          <!-- left off bottom of p. 85/pdf 16 -->
          ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore to you, to anyone not knowing other sciences, 
          this science says what 
          <name>Sarai</name> said to <name>Abraham</name> 
          <ref>Gen 16</ref>
          <quote>Behold, the Lord has closed me up, 
          so that I cannot give birth 
          go therefore to my handmaid, 
          if perhaps at least from her may I have children
          </quote>
          And immediately it follows 
          <quote>When he agreed to her request, 
          she took <name>Agar</name> her Egyptian handmaid
          ten years after they had begun to live together
          </quote>
          This same thing is signified in Genesis 30 
          where it is read that Jacob would not have been able to generate Rachel, 
          unless after he generated sons from her handmaid. 
          Whence it is written there: 
          <quote ana="#gen30_1 #gen30_2 #gen30_3">
            cernens rachel quod infecunda esset habeo inquit famulam balam ingredere
